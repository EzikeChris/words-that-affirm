## Introduction
Words have power. Words contain intention, purpose, meaning. While words such as "healthy" and "wellness" may hold different meanings for different people, they can be used to uplift, empower, and provide support. Our mental health is just as important as our physical health.

I couldn't find a tool on the Internet where the user could see words of affirmation in a fun, exciting way. As a means to provide wellness and a bit of escape from the news, I therefore created a site (mobile and web friendly) that shows a single word of affirmation in a bright background and once the user presses the spacebar, the words change. 

There are about 20+ words of affirmations in the site - please contribute if you like.
